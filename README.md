# travaulta

travaulta is an EC (topre) pcb for mechvault's [Vault35](https://mechvault.net/products/vault-35-mini-keyboard) designed by calvin0563. The pcb supports a single bottomrow layout with the double 1.75u splitbars. Firmware source code and the OEM plate file are available in their respective folders. In order to fit the topre pcb into the case, small modifications to some housings are necessary. Please refer to the extensive build guide by cia\_moonchild in order to learn how to make the assembled pcb fit into the vault35 case.

## Firmware

The basic EC firmware is ready to go and the source code is provided for tweaking any settings.

## Plates & Hardware

The plate file is OEM housing (so original, deskey, klc, pbb housings should all work). Be sure to order the plate in 1.2mm thickness regardless of material.

Furthermore, you will need 17x 10mm M2 screws and M2 nuts to assemble the pcb.

## Credits

big thanks go out to Cain both for the inspiration and the support! My topre work is heavily lifted of Cipulot\#8455's open source work. I could not have done it without these resources. So I want to thank both cipulot and matthewdias\#2671 for their direct input, feedback and help along the way. Much much appreciated!

So many other thanks to go around, I fear I will forget people. There is Ciantha with their amazing guide! A whole bunch of early supporters that made the proto order possible. The keyboard Atelier discord for support. ssbb\#9052 with help with the firmware! And finally Alas/Sofia who decided to get a first GB for this on its feet!!

Any questions, contact Calvin0563 on Discord.
